I/O

Question 1. How to drive an I/O device?
Question 2. How to perform read/write?

Complexity:
1. DMA, interrupts, etc.
2. different types of devices

A division:
- block devices
  - information is in fixed-sized blocks
  - addressable, seekable
  - random access
- character devices
  - information is in a stream of characters, no block structures
  - not addressable nor seekable
  - sequential access

The USB could be treated as a network in a tree structure, with hubs as root
and intermediate nodes, and devices as leaves.

Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller: remembers address, count and control of
a task; DMA requests device to transfer data directly to memory. When the
transfer is completed the device acks to the DMA, then the DMA sends an
interrupt to the CPU. This is called the on-fly mode of operation.

Alternatively DMA could also read data from device, then write to memory; the
write request and data are both sent by the DMA.

Zero-copy: data should not be copied when processing.

DMA controllers and interrupt controllers are limited resources; the CPU needs
to manage their allocation.
