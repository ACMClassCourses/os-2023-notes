## Virtualization

Operating system-based Virtualization refers to an operating system feature in which the kernel enables the existence of various isolated user-space instances. The installation of virtualization software also refers to Operating system-based virtualization. It is installed over a pre-existing operating system and that operating system is called the host operating system. 

In this virtualization, a user installs the virtualization software in the operating system of his system like any other program and utilizes this application to operate and generate various virtual machines. Here, the virtualization software allows direct access to any of the created virtual machines to the user. As the host OS can provide hardware devices with the mandatory support, operating system virtualization may affect compatibility issues of hardware even when the hardware driver is not allocated to the virtualization software. 

Virtualization software is able to convert hardware IT resources that require unique software for operation into virtualized IT resources. As the host OS is a complete operating system in itself, many OS-based services are available as organizational management and administration tools can be utilized for the virtualization host management. 

Some major operating system-based services are mentioned below:  

Backup and Recovery.
Security Management.
Integration to Directory Services.
Various major operations of Operating System Based Virtualization are described below:  

Hardware capabilities can be employed, such as the network connection and CPU.
Connected peripherals with which it can interact, such as a webcam, printer, keyboard, or Scanners.
Data that can be read or written, such as files, folders, and network shares.
The Operating system may have the capability to allow or deny access to such resources based on which the program requests them and the user account in the context of which it runs. OS may also hide these resources, which leads that when a computer program computes them, they do not appear in the enumeration results. Nevertheless, from a programming perspective, the computer program has interacted with those resources and the operating system has managed an act of interaction. 

With operating-system-virtualization or containerization, it is probable to run programs within containers, to which only parts of these resources are allocated. A program that is expected to perceive the whole computer, once run inside a container, can only see the allocated resources and believes them to be all that is available. Several containers can be formed on each operating system, to each of which a subset of the computer’s resources is allocated. Each container may include many computer programs. These programs may run parallel or distinctly, even interrelate with each other. 

## Process

A process is essentially running software. The execution of any process must occur in a specific order. A process refers to an entity that helps in representing the fundamental unit of work that must be implemented in any system.

In other words, we write the computer programs in the form of a text file, thus when we run them, these turn into processes that complete all of the duties specified in the program.

A program can be segregated into four pieces when put into memory to become a process: stack, heap, text, and data. The diagram below depicts a simplified representation of a process in the main memory.

Stack: Temporary data like method or function parameters, return address, and local variables are stored in the process stack.

Heap: This is the memory that is dynamically allocated to a process during its execution.

Text: This comprises the contents present in the processor’s registers as well as the current activity reflected by the value of the program counter.

Data: The global as well as static variables are included in this section.
