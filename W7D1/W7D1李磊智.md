# File System's Challenges

## Limitation of speed of disks
  - Solution:  block cache, page cache (both in memory)

    ### block cache:
    Disk blocks act like a file system and store data as blocks in memory. (hash: facility + block id)

    ### page cache:  
    A page cache is a transparent cache for the pages originating from a secondary storage device. The operating system keeps a page cache in otherwise unused portions of the main memory (RAM), resulting in quicker access to the contents of cached pages and overall performance improvements.

- Adaptability

- Virtualization


## Task struct

- file struct

  - meta data

  - fd  

### Inner Struct:  
> Dentry (directory entry):  
 A dentry is the glue that holds inodes and files together by relating inode numbers to file names. Dentries also play a role in directory caching which, ideally, keeps the most frequently used files on-hand for faster access. File system traversal is another aspect of the dentry as it maintains a relationship between directories and their files.

> d_inode:  
  Accelarate mapping from file path + name to i_node in memory

> f_inode, i_sb ( Points to superblock)
