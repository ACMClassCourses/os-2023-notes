### Distributed Shared Memory

#### DHT/Chord

Files are stored on distributed systems.

$Hash(IP)$ is node's id.

Suppose $suc_i$ is the next available node from $i$.

Finger Table: maintain $suc_{u+2^i}$ for every node $u$. Time complexity lowered to $O(\log n)$.

File is hashed to a number $x$, and is stored in several successors after $x$. Any machine can quickly get $suc_x$ and ask the machine for the file.

Some machines may go offline. Every machine's finger table is self-maintained.

When a machine enter the system, notify other machines to update finger table.
