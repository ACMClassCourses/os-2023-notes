### Memory Management

Reallocation, Swapping, Overlay, Replacement

#### Swapping
Memory <- exchange processes -> disk storage

#### Virtual Memory & Paging

Consider a part of disk as extension of memory

#### Page replacement algorithms

Optimal algorithm is based on the future

- NRU (not recently used) algorithm

Referenced bit and Modified bit

- FIFO algorithm
- Second-chance algorithm
- Clock algorithm
- LRU (least recently used) algorithm
- Working set algorithm

#### Physical Memory Management
Buddy System (UNIX)

Maintain lists of blocks of $2^i$ size.

Breaks large blocks into 2 smaller blocks when allocating.

Merge requirements:
- same size
- next to each other
- after merging into a $2^{i+1}$ size block, the beginning of block should be a multple of $2^{i+1}$
