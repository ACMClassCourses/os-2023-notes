# W3D2&W8D1&W11D2

# W3D2

## Process & threads

#### 1. synchronize

- lock, mutex, semaphore
  - mutex means: mutual exclusion.
  - method 1: lock variable. 
  - method 2: Peterson. 

- CLI/busywaiting/sleepwakeup

#### 2. Process/Thread Scheduling

#### 3. Memory consistency

**memory barriers:** to protect the code sequences, which might be edit by compiler, tomasulo,  etc..

> A barrier is: Cannot change two code if one is before-barrier and the other is after-barrier.

#### 4. CPU scheduling

- Q: who's next?!
  - according to priority.
- Avoiding locks
  - Read-copy-update

**Scheduling methods:** 

Run Queue(round robin). time-slice as a unit. 

**Tradeoff:** context switch

# W8D1

### 1. Security

**Exp: ** login, password, DoS

**Definition: ** TCB

### 2. Authentication

Methods of authenticating users when they attempt to log in based on one of three general principles:

- Something the user knows.
- Something the user has.
- Something the user is.

### 3. Buffer Overflow Attacks

### 4. Multilevel SecurityBell-LaPadula Model

Bell-LaPadula Model rules for information flow:

- The simple security property
  Process running at security level k can read only objects at its level or lower
- The property
  Process running at security level k can write only objects at its level or higher

# W11D2

### 1. Multi-core/Processor/computer

SMC/SMP/cluster/Grid/Cloud...

multi: shared memory, multi-CPU

UMA-NUMA

multiple spinlock, bus

- Avoid cache thrashing!
- Time sharing, the art of scheduling

"Gang scheduling" : A gang of related threads are scheduled as a unit, a "gang"

"Computational Graph": ->"A platform for ML"

"Distributed Shared Memory": Like page table, with indices

### 2. Graph computing

relations between Nodes, allocation of resources,...

GraphChi

Speed up executing, space less, locality is good.

And we have algorithms.

Object-based middleware "**CORBA**"

Based on CORBA. Distributed systems.
