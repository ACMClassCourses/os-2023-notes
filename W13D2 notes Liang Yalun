Ideas in Android architecture

- Java VM: Dalvik / ART
- Init system: zygote
  Linux startup process: pid 0 (kernel space) starts init (user space) process, and init starts other userspace processes.
  zygote is the init process for Java processes; all IPC are controlled by zygote, and all Java processes are directly started by zygote (no startup by other processes).
- Binder: IPC
  Uses a kernel module to perform IPC
- Parcel: serializer/deserializer
- Android Interface Design Language / AIDL
  Provides transparent RPC
- Wake locks
