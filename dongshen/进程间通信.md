#### inter-process communication (IPC)
1.  Pipes: between two processes running on the same machine. One process writes data to the pipe, and the other process reads from it.
2.  Shared Memory: Shared memory is a technique that allows two or more processes to access the same area of memory. faster.
3.  Message Queues: One process sends a message to a queue, and another process reads from the same queue to receive the message.
4.  Sockets: communication by a network. One process establishes a socket, and the other process  connects to it.
5.  [[Semaphores]]: A semaphore is a synchronization tool that allows processes to synchronize access to a shared resource. It is often used in combination with shared memory to ensure that multiple processes can access the same memory area without conflicts.
#### reduce  the conflicts in IPC ( or deal with Race Condition)
1.  Mutual Exclusion: implemented using synchronization primitives such as **semaphores, mutexes, or locks**. When a process wants to access a shared resource, it first requests **the mutual exclusion lock**. If the lock is available, the process can proceed to access the resource. When it is done, it releases the lock so that another process can acquire it. If the lock is not available, the process waits until it becomes available. preventing conflicts in shared memory, critical sections, or other shared resources.

2.  Synchronization: using synchronization primitives such as **signals, events, or barriers**. For example, memory barrier/ message queue `mb()`
3.  Message Passing:  using message queues, pipes, or sockets. When a process wants to send data to another process, it puts the data into a message or packet and sends it to the receiving process, preventing conflicts in situations where processes need to exchange data but should not access each other's memory directly.
4.  Priority Scheduling: using scheduling algorithms that assign priorities to processes based on their importance or urgency. For example, a process that is handling critical data might be given a higher priority than a process that is handling non-critical data.     
5.  Resource Allocation: algorithms that allocate resources based on some criteria, such as the amount of resources required or the time required to complete a task.
