multi: shared memory, multi-CPU

UMA-NUMA

multiple spinlock, bus

- Avoid cache thrashing!

- Time sharing, the  art of scheduling

"Gang scheduling" : A gang of related threads are scheduled as a unit, a "gang"

"Computational Graph": ->"A platform for ML"

"Distributed Shared Memory":  Like page table, with indices



#### Graph computing

relations between Nodes, allocation of resources,...

Speed up executing, space less, locality is good.

And we have alogorithms.
