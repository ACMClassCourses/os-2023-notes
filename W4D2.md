## Memory Management

#### Concepts

- No Memory Abstraction
  - reallocation (static/dynamic)
  - swapping
- Virutal Memory
  - need to run programs that are too large to fit in memory
  - no explicit swapping -> OS does it
- Page Replacement Algorithm
  - Optimal algorithm (based on the future)
  - NRU (not recently used) algorithm
    - Referenced bit and Modified bit
    - class0: not R not M
    - class 1: not R, M
    - class 2: R, not M
    - class 3: R and M
  - FIFO algorithm
  - Second-chance algorithm
  - Clock algorithm
    - optimize the queue: only the clock ptr needs to move
  - LRU (least recently used) algorithm
    - complex for hardware
    - simulating LRU in software: aging algorithm
  - Working set algorithm
    - each process focus on a set of pages
  - WSClock algorithm

##### Physical Memory Management

- Buddy System (UNIX)
  - allocate $2^m$ continual physical pages(frames)
  - free_areas[] (list head)
  - buddy: $2k*2^n$ and $(2k+1)*2^n$
  - used in Linux since 1970s.   why efficient?
