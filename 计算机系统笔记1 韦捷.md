Synchronization 

---- Intra : IPC

IPC : 

- PA sends DATA to PB ( pipe() )
- PB wait ... from PA ( signal )
- PA race .. with PB : race condition



SPOOLING

---- on-line ( main frame)

- perahon
- Peripheral 
- Multaneous 



Critical Region

PA : --------------- critical region ( be careful ! ) -----------

Why ? ------- mutual and exclusive



Example 1 :

int lock = 0;

Thread a : 

```c++
{
  while(lock == 1){
    ** do nothing. just waiting. **
  }
  lock = 1;
  ** work region **
  lock = 0;
}
```

Thread b :

```c++
{
  while(lock == 1){
    ** do nothing. just waiting. **
  }
  lock = 1;
  ** work region **
  lock = 0;
}
```



( share ) mutual :

- CLI ( clear / clean , I for interruption ) is an instruction. 
- Busy wait
- Sleep / wake up



Requirements to avoid race conditions :

1. No two processes may be simultaneously inside their critical regions.
2. No assumptions may be made about speeds of the numbers of CPUs.
3. No process running outside its critical region may block other process.
4. No process should have to wait forever to enter its critical region.



---- Outline :

- CLI
- TSL / EXEC
- SW : strict ALT / peterson
