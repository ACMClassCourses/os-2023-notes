Q: Addressing

- Message
  - packet
  - document
  - file (page)
- Shared Memory (OS does it)
  - directory (translation)



#### DHT(Chord)

Background: distributed searching

Basic: any content $K_i = Hash(...)$

- machine $i$ has file A.mpg: $Hash(A.mpg) = 1$, then let machine 1 hold the information that A.mpg is owned by $i$
- query A.mpg: Hash = 1 $\to$ ask machine 1 for the owner $\to$ go to owner $i$

Challenge: some machine may be offline

- $succ(i)$: $i$'s next online machine
- finger table: for each online machine, maintain $succ$ of $s+2^k,k=0,1,2,...$ on machine $s$
- every time a machine becomes online: broadcast, other machines update finger table



#### Distributed Systems

- Chip: SoC (System on Chip)  
- Board: SMP (Symmetric Pultiprocessing)  recall: reentrant functions
- LAN: Cluster
- Internet: Grid $\to$ Cloud
